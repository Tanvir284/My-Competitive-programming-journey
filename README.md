# My Competitive Programming Journey

This repository contains my personal archive of competitive programming solutions and notes. All code was written in C++ and python while practicing on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/ruhittanvir14). It serves both as a learning resource and a demonstration of my problem solving approach.

## Contents

- **`Code Forces/`** – directory with over 120 solved problems from Codeforces.
- **`CP BOOK.pdf`** – reference material that I used during my studies.

Each solution file is self‑contained and can be compiled independently. The common structure includes fast I/O setup and useful macros to keep solutions concise.

## Compiling a Solution

To compile any solution with g++, run:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -pipe -static -s <solution.cpp> -o solution
./solution
```

Replace `<solution.cpp>` with the name of the desired file. Most problems read from standard input and write to standard output.

## Why This Repository

I created this repository to track my progress and refine my algorithmic thinking. Recruiters and fellow developers can glance through the variety of problems solved to gauge my proficiency with different techniques and my ability to write clear, efficient C++ code.

Feel free to explore the solutions or use them as references for your own practice.
